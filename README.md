<!-- Problem Solving -->

<h3 id="research">üî¨ Research</h3>

#### Industry Analysis

Since this was my first experience delving into the business space of ERP systems, I wanted to do preliminary research before having an in-depth conversation with Novohit. Approaching the situation with pre-existing knowledge would help myself and the client set realistic expectations going forward.

I spent a week familiarizing myself with the **who**, the **what**, and the **why** of enterprise systems.

-   **Who** is it designed for?
-   **What** is ERP?
-   **Why** do companies use it? etc.

#### Novohit Q&A

Following my initial research, I prepared a Q&A discussion with Novohit to:

-   define the project's timeline
-   generate ideas for the website's design and user experience
-   learn more about the company's product and target audience

This was an introspective exercise to help me understand Novohit's vision and resolve future concerns in hindsight.

#### User Research (Surveys)

The previously mentioned Q&A only revealed a partial understanding of Novohit's expectations as a company. I needed more feedback from customers and users themselves to understand how the company's audience felt about their website.

Working with limited resources, I drafted a Google Survey that introduced respondees to **[Novohit's old website](#sitemap-novohit-old)** and asked them to answer a series of questions regarding their initial impressions.

#### User Research (Personas)

I continued my research by drafting personas from the information in my initial Q&A with Novohit. While the portraits in the below image are fictional, the information represented in each card is indicative of Novohit's existing clientele and incoming customers from the U.S.

#### Competitor Analysis

The final step in my research process was a simple competitive analysis of existing ERP developers to see how others solve similar problems. My challenge was to create or adopt a solution for managing the plethora of information that hindered Novohit's antiquated website navigation. The company wanted a more fundamental method for organizing and presenting information to new and existing customers which we solved with a single-page application.

The below image represents my competitor research and includes observations about other sites' user interfaces and experience.

<!-- plan -->

<h3 id="plan">üìÖ Plan</h3>

Following the project's research phase, it was time to focus on user experience. My initial introspection with Novohit helped to identify two key objectives that influenced the proposal pictured below ‚Äî to be accessibile and approachable.

Novohit wanted more customer outreach to users on tablets and mobile phones, as well as a design that would assist new customers with finding a product for their specific use case. This would assure existing clients could find the information they need while helping new clients identify useful services that Novohit provides.
