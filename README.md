<!-- Industry Analysis -->

<h5 id="industry-analysis">Industry Analysis</h5>

<p>Since this was my first opportunity exploring the business space of ERP systems, I decided to do preliminary research before having an in-depth conversation with Novohit. Approaching the situation with pre-existing knowledge would create realistic expectations for the client and I moving forward.

I spent a week familiarizing myself with the <b>who</b>, the <b>what</b>, and the <b>why</b> of enterprise systems.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Who</b> is it designed for?</li>
    <li><b>What</b> is ERP?</li>
    <li><b>Why</b> do companies use it? etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information was pivotal during live discussions with Novohit's CEO regarding the design and user experience of their new website. Becoming well-versed in the company's roles, responsibilities, values, and expectations had helped me create a more meaningful experience for Novohit and its customers, and allowed me to embody professionalism as a UI/UX Developer.</p>

<img src="assets/research-industry-analysis-min.jpg" alt="industry analysis" />

<!-- Novohit Q&A -->

<h5 id="novohit-q-and-a">Novohit Q&A</h5>

<p>Following my initial research, I prepared a Q&A discussion with Novohit to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Define the project's timeline</li>
    <li>Generate ideas for the website's design and user experience</li>
    <li>Learn more about the company's product and target audience</li>
</ul>

<p>This was an introspective exercise to help me understand Novohit's vision and resolve future concerns in hindsight. My primary concern was feature creep and I wanted to define a set of guidelines before getting started. While there were many decisions made during the development phase, I created a future-proof system to coordinate with any priority shifts or newly generated ideas.

For example, midway through the design phase of Novohit's product page, I was asked to align the company's assets with their recently updated branding scheme. At the time, I leveraged Figma as my design program of choice and was learning how to create scalable design systems while applying these practices during the project's development. I was able to apply variations and change global styles to update the existing designs in just a few clicks, instead of having to comb through every custom component and update styles individually.</p>

<!-- User Research (Surveys) -->

<h5 id="user-research-surveys">User Research (Surveys)</h5>

<p>The previously mentioned Q&A only revealed a partial understanding of Novohit's expectations as a company. I needed more feedback from customers and users themselves to understand how the company's audience felt about the Novohit website.

Working with limited resources, I drafted a Google Survey that introduced respondees to <b><a href="#sitemap-novohit-old">Novohit's old website</a></b> and asked them to answer a series of questions regarding their initial impressions. The feedback assisted us with making informed decisions about the proposed user experience and allowed Novohit to reflect on its customer impressions.</p>

#### User Research (Personas)

I continued my research by drafting personas from the information in my initial Q&A with Novohit. While the portraits in the below image are fictional, the information represented in each card is indicative of Novohit's existing clientele and incoming customers from the U.S.

#### Competitor Analysis

The final step in my research process was a simple competitive analysis of existing ERP developers to see how others solve similar problems. My challenge was to create or adopt a solution for managing the plethora of information that hindered Novohit's antiquated website navigation. The company wanted a more fundamental method for organizing and presenting information to new and existing customers which we solved with a single-page application.

<h3 id="plan">üìÖ Plan</h3>

Following the project's research phase, it was time to focus on user experience. My initial introspection with Novohit helped to identify two key objectives that influenced the proposal pictured below ‚Äî to be accessibile and approachable.

Novohit wanted more customer outreach to users on tablets and mobile phones, as well as a design that would assist new customers with finding a product for their specific use case. This would assure existing clients could find the information they need while helping new clients identify useful services that Novohit provides.
